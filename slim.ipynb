The airline said Thursday morning in a disclosure that it had been expecting to grow its capacity from 3% to 5% this year, but it now expects the growth to be “at or below the lower end of this range.” Alaska Airline’s announcement came on the heels of the Federal Aviation Administration late Wednesday clearing a path for the planes to return to service but halting Boeing’s plans to increase production of them.\n",

And never will be,” it added.  Francl also found little sympathy in the British press, which took her suggestion with more than a pinch of salt.\n",
